    <p>This is an individual project that I worked on during my time at UVA's Master's in Data Science program. This was arguably the most exciting project that I've done there, as it combined my two interests: statistical analysis and theatre. </p>
    <p>Statistical methods: Principle Component Analysis, Topic Models, Word Embeddings (word2vec) and Sentiment Analysis</p>
    <p>Programming language used: Python</p>
