    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I work on individual projects to stay up-to-date with recent technology and to keep my skills fresh. Broadly speaking, my personal interest is in human emotion and behavior, so my project topics gravitate towards them.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>In Progress:</h2>
    <h3>Audio Sentiment Project</h3>
    <p>Using data from <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/1188976#.XsAXemgzaUk">The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)</a></p> to explore how neural networks can identify emotions in audio files.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Completed:</h2>
    <h3><a href="text_analytics.html">Text Analysis Project</a></h3>
    <p>This is an individual project that I worked on during my time at UVA's Master's in Data Science program. This was arguably the most exciting project that I've done there, as it combined my two interests: statistical analysis and fine arts. </p>
    <p>Statistical methods: Principle Component Analysis, Topic Models, Word Embeddings (word2vec) and Sentiment Analysis</p>
    <p>Languages used: Python, HTML</p>
