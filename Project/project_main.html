    <h3><a href="https://data-sciencehub.github.io/Tax/">Operationalizing Historical Data: Digitization and Exploration of 1867 Virginia Tax Records</a></h3>
    <p>This project was done in collaboration with two other students during my time at UVA's Master's in Data Science program.</p>
    <p>This project tackles the challenges of incomplete historical data by operationalizing personal property tax records from five Virginia counties in 1867. Digitized by the non-profit organization <i>One Shared Story</i>, these records capture a transformative post-emancipation era. Through data cleaning, modeling, and a scalable web application, the project makes this data publicly accessible and analyzable. Exploratory techniques reveal its potential to uncover historical context, particularly about marginalized communities, proving even sparse datasets can yield meaningful insights.</p>
    <p>Languages/Technologies used: Python, NoSQL (MongoDB), Cloud Computing (AWS)</p>

    <h3><a href="text_analytics.html">Text Analysis Project</a></h3>
    <p>This is an individual project that I worked on during my time at UVA's Master's in Data Science program. </p>
    <p>Theatrical performances captivate audiences with live storytelling, but how are these experiences perceived and discussed? This project dives into approximately 300 theatre performance reviews, applying techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Topic Modeling, Word Embeddings (word2vec), and Sentiment Analysis. By uncovering patterns, themes, and sentiments within the reviews, the project sheds light on the critical discourse surrounding theatrical art, offering a deeper understanding of how performances resonate with audiences.</p>
    <p>Statistical methods: Principle Component Analysis, Topic Models, Word Embeddings (word2vec) and Sentiment Analysis</p>
    <p>Languages/Technologies used: Python, HTML</p>
