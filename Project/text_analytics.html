    <h1>Text Analysis of Shakespeare Performance Reviews</h1>
    <p>This is an individual project that I worked on during my time at UVA's Master's in Data Science program. This was arguably the most exciting project that I've done there, as it combined my two interests: statistical analysis and theatre.</p>
